<meta name=description content="Juan Maria Bollé is a Belgian painter  with Spanish roots. As a contemporary Flemish artist, his paintings are characterised by bright full colours and black and white figurative elements completed with abstract colour fields. His medium is oil on canvas, the realistic fragments of nudes, portraits or landscapes are common, but the global context and interpretation is complex. The paintings consist of several figurative images and abstract elements, made by compositions of split screens. Therefore his art and exhibitions transcend the realistic iconography. His technique is related to pop art and colour field painting, but interpreted in a highly personal, contemporary vision.">
